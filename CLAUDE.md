# Claude Instructions

## Elegance Principle
For each proposed change, examine the existing system and redesign it into the most elegant solution that would have emerged if the change had been a foundational assumption from the start.

## Code Quality
- TypeScript strict mode. No `any` without justification.
- Every change should leave the codebase better than you found it.
- Run `npm run build` before committing — zero errors.
