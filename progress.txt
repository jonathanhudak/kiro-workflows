# Progress Log
Run: feature-dev
Task: Build production-ready Kiro CLI multi-agent workflow system
Started: 2026-02-10T08:32:00-08:00

## Codebase Patterns
- This is a config/content repo — no build system, no package.json
- Agent files are JSON in .kiro/agents/, one per agent role
- Valid Kiro tools: fs_read, fs_write, fs_list, execute_bash, use_mcp
- Agent JSON schema: name, description, prompt, tools, allowedTools, resources
- allowedTools must be a subset of tools
- Steering files are markdown in .kiro/steering/
- Tests are bash scripts in tests/

## 2026-02-10 08:32 - US-001: Validate and normalize all agent JSON files
- Fixed allowedTools for 5 agents to match their tools array (compound, developer, fixer, planner, tester)
- Created validate-agents.sh with checks for: JSON validity, required fields, valid tool names, allowedTools⊆tools
- Created tests/test-validate-agents.sh with 11 test cases
- **Learnings:** planner only had fs_read+fs_list in allowedTools despite needing fs_write; the pattern of tools vs allowedTools is intentional (tools=capabilities, allowedTools=permissions) but they were inconsistent

## 2026-02-10 08:52 - US-003: Improve planner and developer agent prompts using antfarm inspiration
- Enhanced planner.json prompt from 577 to 3185 chars (5.5x): added EARS notation examples, 3-phase workflow (requirements→design→tasks), output file specs (requirements.md, design.md, tasks.md), dependency ordering, task sizing (S/M/L), ADR format
- Enhanced developer.json prompt from ~400 to 3022 chars: added progress tracking (.kiro/progress.md), commit discipline rules, test-writing requirements (happy path + 2 edge cases), error handling patterns, pre-submit checklist
- Drew inspiration from antfarm agents: verifier's checklist approach, setup agent's structured output, compound agent's reflection pattern
- Created tests/test-agent-prompts.sh with 13 test cases covering prompt length, content requirements, and JSON validity
- **Learnings:** Antfarm agents in ~/Projects/antfarm/agents/shared/ have role-specific AGENTS.md files; good patterns: structured output formats, explicit "what NOT to do" sections, checklist-style verification
---

## 2026-02-10 09:12 - US-004: Improve reviewer, verifier, and compound agent prompts
- Enhanced reviewer.json: added BLOCKING/SHOULD_FIX/SUGGESTION severity levels, structured output format with file:line references, VERDICT summary block, steering file references
- Enhanced verifier.json: added explicit Decision Framework with Approve (STATUS: done) and Reject (STATUS: retry) criteria, modeled after antfarm verifier AGENTS.md, STATUS as first-line output for automation
- Enhanced compound.json: YAML frontmatter format (date, workflow, task, category, tags), output to docs/learnings/YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md, learning categories (technical/process/quality), one file per workflow run
- Created tests/test-us004-prompts.sh with 21 test cases validating all prompt content requirements
- **Learnings:** Verifier feedback was precise — always check that the actual file content matches the story spec, not just that "something was added". YAML frontmatter vs markdown headers is a meaningful distinction.

## 2026-02-10 09:22 - US-005: Improve tester, scanner, fixer, triager, and investigator agent prompts
- Enhanced all 5 agent prompts to 4000-5200 chars each (from ~500-900, well over 2x)
- tester.json: added test file naming conventions, coverage expectations, AAA test structure template, parameterized test guidance
- scanner.json: added 6-phase scanning methodology with specific commands (npm audit, grep for secrets, license-checker), severity classification table
- fixer.json: added fix workflow (understand→design→apply→test→verify), fix documentation template with CWE references, regression test requirements
- triager.json: added priority classification table (P0-P3), escalation criteria, effort estimation (S/M/L/XL), blast radius analysis
- investigator.json: added 6-phase investigation methodology, git bisect walkthrough, log analysis commands, hypothesis tracking table
- All prompts include structured output format sections and "What NOT to Do" sections
- Created tests/test-us005-prompts.sh with 33 test cases — all passing
- **Learnings:** Consistent prompt structure across agents (Methodology → Classification → What NOT to Do → Structured Output) makes them predictable and composable
